<!-- ## 👋 &nbsp;Hey there! I'm Santi -->

### 🌍 &nbsp;About Me
🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working on Full Stack development at NEORIS, where I focus on building robust web applications using technologies like Dart, TypeScript, Java, and JavaScript.

🌱 &nbsp;I’m currently learning advanced concepts in Cybersecurity through my master's degree, aiming to integrate secure coding practices into my development workflow.

👯 &nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that leverage my skills in Dart, TypeScript, and Java, particularly in the areas of front-end development with frameworks like Angular and back-end services with Spring Boot.

🤔 &nbsp;I’m looking for expanding my expertise in cloud-native development and microservices architecture, as well as deepening my understanding of secure coding and application security.

⚡ &nbsp;I’m a coding enthusiast who enjoys combining the power of modern programming languages with the principles of clean code and security, ensuring that my applications are not only functional but also secure and maintainable.
